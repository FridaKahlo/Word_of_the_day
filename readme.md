## Quick git reference

Command      |   Description
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git init          | The git init command creates a new Git repository
git add         | The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.
Git status     |The command checks the status and reports that there’s nothing to commit.
Git commit <file> –m <message> | to save your work into Git version control
Git config     | lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates
Git diff  | displays the differences between two versions in detail
Git log | lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order – that is, the most recent commits show up first.
